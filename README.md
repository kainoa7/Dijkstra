# Dijkstra's Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python, along with an example of visualizing the shortest paths using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Description

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

The provided implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It uses a priority queue to greedily select the vertex with the shortest distance at each step, ensuring optimality of the computed paths.

## How to Use

To use this implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the following command to execute the script:

    ```
    python dijkstra.py
    ```

6. The script will output the shortest distances from the specified start vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
7. Additionally, it will display a visualization of the graph with the shortest paths using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
